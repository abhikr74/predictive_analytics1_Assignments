The U.S. SBA (Small Business Administration) was founded in 1953 on the principle of promoting and
assisting small enterprises in the U.S. credit market. Small businesses have been a primary source of job
creation in the United States; therefore, fostering small business formation and growth has social benefits by
creating job opportunities and reducing unemployment. One way SBA assists these small business enterprises
is through a loan guarantee program which is designed to encourage banks to grant loans to small businesses.
SBA acts much like an insurance provider to reduce the risk for a bank by taking on some of the risk through
guaranteeing a portion of the loan. In the case that a loan goes into default, SBA then covers the amount
they guaranteed. There have been many success stories of start-ups receiving SBA loan guarantees such
as FedEx and Apple. However, there have also been stories of small businesses and/or start-ups that have
defaulted on their SBA-guaranteed loans.
Since SBA loans only guarantee a portion of the entire loan balance, banks will incur some losses if a small
business defaults on its SBA-guaranteed loan. Therefore, banks are still faced with a difficult choice as to the
amount they should grant such a loan because of the high risk of default. One way to inform their decision
making is through analyzing relevant historical data such as the data-set provided here.
